# FirebasePush
An app that uses firebase to allow users to login and send each other messages

I learned a lot from following this tutorial from understanding fragments/activties/objects/style/onSucces/onFail.
It was very complex espically writing the code for the functions that work in the firebase server but even following it 
fell into many problems/
Main issue when following is that some of the firebase code used or gradle has been outdated or no longer used.

This project comes from this youtube tutorial
